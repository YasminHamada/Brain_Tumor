# Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection
There are important question we are think about :
 - Can we make predict the brain has a tumor or not using data science?

## Objective
- Apply deep learning algorithms to real-world tasks.
- Increase knowledge about the workflow of the  deep learning tasks.
- Learn how to clean data, applying pre-processing, feature engineering, cnn and others methods. 
   
## Main Steps: :
- Apply pre-processing on the provided dataset. (Preprocess all the features even if we wonâ€™t use them later after feature selection)
- Apply visualization sample of data

## Preprocessing: 
- Before building models, We need to make sure that the dataset is clean and ready-to-use.

## cnn model
- Split your dataset into 60% training , 30% validation and 10% testing.
- Apply VGG16 techniques to increase the number of layers to improve accuracy.

## accuracy
- train accuracy: 99.2%
- validation accuracy: 100.0%
